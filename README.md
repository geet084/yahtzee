## Background
This project began as a challenge, could I build a game, without frameworks, that behaved like a native app? This of course involved making it a Progressive Web App as well as not having some of the luxuries that come with frameworks like React and Vue.

## About
Yahtzee is an app where you can roll some dice in your free time. Whether you play by yourself or against the computer, enjoy your favorite game of chance from the convenience of your phone.

The rules are simple: you have up to 3 turns to roll 5 dice. Your goal is to score the maximum amount per box on the left (upper) section. On the right, you are looking to match the icon with either: 
 - 3 of a kind
 - 4 of a kind
 - Full house (a pair and 3 of a kind)
 - Small (4 consecutive) straight
 - Large (5 consecutive) straight
 - Yahtzee (5 of a kind)
 - Chance (total of all your dice)

 The game will also track your top 3 highest scores and when you got them.
